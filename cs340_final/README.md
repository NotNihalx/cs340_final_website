# CS-340 Project

This project attempts to create a secondary, introductury site to help new players find about Leauge of Legends.
In the search page, I was going to attempt to have users submit requests from the riot API, but due to difficulties in
obtaining an API key for league (have to submit an application for useage), I had to scrap that idea so the search.html page
is a bit incomplete. More information given there.

# Sources

- Riot Games/League of Legends official website for most skill gifs, splash arts, and league icons
- W3Schools Carousel Guide for implementing the carousel image slider.
- Skin spotlights for some splash arts
- Champion.GG for images regarding ability pathway images
- Individual Youtube thumbnails given to their various linked content creators.
- Tito Hinostroza for library on dynamic HTML tables

# Notes:

Each section has the appropriate code for the page it is trying to display. In these pages, you will find the source code needed for it to run with comments in different places to explain code that might not be obivous in how it is implemented.

Due to both members of the team being very busy the last 4+ weeks due to work/real life stuff, we could not get much of the back end implemented. This is primarily front end but we do have some sql files included (that may or may not be functional) to show we have at least some mastery of what was being learned in class.
