# CS-290 Project

This project attempts to create a secondary, introductury site to help new players find about Leauge of Legends.
In the search page, I was going to attempt to have users submit requests from the riot API, but due to difficulties in
obtaining an API key for league (have to submit an application for useage), I had to scrap that idea so the search.html page
is a bit incomplete. More information given there.

# Sources

- Riot Games/League of Legends official website for most skill gifs, splash arts, and league icons
- W3Schools Carousel Guide for implementing the carousel image slider.
- Skin spotlights for some splash arts
- Champion.GG for images regarding ability pathway images
- Individual Youtube thumbnails given to their various linked content creators.
